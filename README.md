## Overview

When doing an SCCM or MDT Operating System Deployment a common task is to customize the background that is shown during the various stages of the build in order to brand the build or to just indicate the main build tasks.

During Windows 7 setup there is a window that shows the message "Setup is preparing your computer for first use". On Windows 8 and Windows 10 that message is "Getting Ready" or the circling dots animation. These setup windows obscure the background thus hiding our custom background.

The only solution is to create a new custom window and place it above this progress window and fill it with our wallpaper bitmap thus creating a "fake" background.
